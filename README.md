# Student-Killer

# STILL IN BETA | script might not work as expected.

A  simple batch script made to kill and/or delete classroom-cloud and netsupport

On execution you will see "Windows protected your PC", this is because I need to buy a license to make the script "recognized" by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen.
I do not have the kind of money to do that.

Simply. To run the script, click on "more info", and then "run anyways".

DISCLAIMER: I am not responible if any harm is done with this script.
